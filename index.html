			<h2>JavaScript Basics</h1>
			<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a veriety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight langauge allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of idfferent directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a webrowser or Nod server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variable are containers for storing data values - imagine a cpu you filled with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unqique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <strong>var x;</strong> </li>
				<li><a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <strong>var x = 10;</strong></li>
				<li><a href="">Data types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data stypes that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false;</strong> null - <strong>null</strong> aka nothing; Number - <strong>42</strong> or <strong>3.14159;</strong> String - <strong>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</strong> Array - <strong>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</strong> and Object - <strong>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</strong></li>
				<li><a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different ecisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to aacopmlish this. There are the following conditional statements: <strong>if</strong> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block: <strong>else</strong> if to specifiy a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <strong>else</strong> we execute this block of code;</li>
				<li><a href="">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they allessentialy do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
				<li><a href="">Function</a> Functions are en encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to teh table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over over again.</li>
